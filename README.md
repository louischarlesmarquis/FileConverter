# FileConverter

Academic project in Object Oriented Programming 2 (COMP249)

The task of this assignment is to design and implement a program that transfers the contents
of Excel tables to a website in a best way possible. Based on my investigation, I have determined that the
best option is to convert the Excel tables into HTML tables. Hence, I designed and implemented a Java tool
called CSV2HTML to read and process CSV files and create HTML tables.
