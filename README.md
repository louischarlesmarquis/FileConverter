Instructions:

As a software designer, you have been tasked by the PR department to design and implement a program to transfer the contents
of the Excel tables to the hospitalâ€™s website in a best way possible. Based on your investigation, you have determined that the
best option is to convert the Excel tables into HTML tables. You are therefore required to design and implement a Java tool
